      # Note: This workflow builds the application, but deployment should be done via Vercel
      # GitHub Pages does not support Next.js server-side routes (like /api/*)
      # 
      # To deploy:
      # 1. Connect your repository to Vercel at https://vercel.com
      # 2. Set environment variables in Vercel Dashboard:
      #    - SITE_KEY: secure random string
      #    - NOTIFICATIONAPI_CLIENT_ID: your NotificationAPI client ID
      #    - NOTIFICATIONAPI_CLIENT_SECRET: your NotificationAPI secret
      #    - BREVO_API_KEY: your Brevo API key
      #    - CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT: your Convex deployment ID (e.g., prod:cool-dragon-482)
      #    - NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL: your Convex deployment URL (https://...)
      #    - DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL: (optional) default sender email
      # 3. Push to main branch - Vercel will automatically deploy
